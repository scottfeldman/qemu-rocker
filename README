qemu-rocker is an effort to develop a new network switch simulated device for
qemu.  The switch is ficituos.  It doesn't exist in the real world.  It is a
vechicle to develop a device driver and device driver model in the Linux
kernel.  The design of the switch device's hardware interface is approximating
existing real-world enterprise-class switches.  Being a simulation of a real
switch device, rocker switch device attempts to function as a real switch
would.  Functions including, for example, L2 bridging, L3 routing, ACL
filtering, and tunneling.  Interfaces to hardware expose traditional L2/L3
object management, such as fdb and fib objects, as well as a flow-based
objects, such as flow table and group table.
