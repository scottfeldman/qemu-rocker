qemu-rocker is a simulated ethernet switch device.  The device supports
up to 62 front-panel ports and supports L2 and L3 switching and routing
functions.  The device presents a single PCI device for the switch, with
a memory-mapped register space for device driver access.

qemu-rocker currently supports a switch model based on Broadcom's OF-DPA
switch.  See Broadcom's OF-DPA sepcification version 1.0 for more info on
OF-DPA.  qemu-rocker could support other switch models in the future.
